Hey Bob, just wanted to confirm that we're all set up and secure on the protocol. Everything looks good on my end - seeing the handshake complete and all the right signals!
Perfect, Alice. Same here, no issues at all. The encryption layers seem to be working flawlessly, and I've got authentication on my end verified. Nice and smooth.
Good to hear! It's refreshing to have something that's both quick and secure. Remember last time we were dealing with those laggy verifications? Nightmare!
Oh, don't remind me! This setup is like a dream by comparison. Plus, no random dropouts or mismatches so far, which is huge. Any initial thoughts on how it's handling under load?
Actually, I did a quick test, and it's holding up impressively well. Even with some extra simulated traffic, everything stayed stable. I think we're good to start scaling soon!
That's awesome news! Let's monitor it for a bit longer, but I have a feeling this might finally be the solution we've been waiting for. Thanks for all your setup work, Alice!
